Hi, I am Dipak from Pepsicola. I am a graduate in Information Management.

# The 2 days session on git and github was very learning oriented and insightful
Many thanks to Milan sir and GCA. I hope to be part of other sessions like this in the days to come.
I really enjoyed and learned a lot about git and github within these 2 days.
Thanks a lot again.
